## Quick start


## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://getbootstrap.com/>. The docs may also be run locally.

Documentation search is powered by [Algolia's DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/). Working on our search? Be sure to set `debug: true` in the `_scripts.html` include.

### Running documentation locally

1. Run through the [tooling setup](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/build-tools/#tooling-setup) to install Jekyll (the site builder) and other Ruby dependencies with `bundle install`.
2. Run `npm install` to install Node.js dependencies.
3. Run `npm run test` (or a specific NPM script) to rebuild distributed CSS and JavaScript files, as well as our docs assets.
4. From the root `/sncf-bootstrap` directory, run `npm run docs-serve` in the command line.
5. Open `http://localhost:9001` in your browser, and voil√†.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
