## Requirements

- `npm 5.6.0` OR `yarn 1.15.2` (follow instructions from Yarn or NPM officials to install last versions on Debian/Ubuntu systems
- `node v8.10.0`

## How to build

First steps, install dependencies, go inside bootstrap-sncf directory, then :

1. `yarn install` to install Node.js dependencies.
2. _Documentation building only_ Run through the [tooling setup](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/build-tools/#tooling-setup) to install Jekyll (the site builder) and other Ruby dependencies with `bundle install`.

To compile Bootstrap-SNCF you will have to :

1. Decide which version you need (intern or extern, cf. [SNCF Digital resources](http://sn.cf/socledesign))
2. Run `yarn run build-intern` or `yarn run build-extern` to build all the project, including distributed CSS and JavaScript files, as well as our docs assets.
3. Run `yarn run dist-intern` or `yarn run dist-extern` to generate `dist/` folder with minified css & js, and assets (icons & fonts).

### Running documentation locally

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://getbootstrap.com/>. The docs may also be run locally.

Documentation search is powered by [Algolia's DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/).

1. From the root `/bootstrap-sncf` directory, run `yarn run docs-serve-intern` or `yarn run docs-serve-extern` in the command line **after building the version you want**
2. Open `http://localhost:9001` in your browser, and voilà. Modifications in `template` folder will force regenerating.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).

### NPM

Simply use `npm install @sncf/bootstrap-sncf.metier` or `npm install @sncf/bootstrap-sncf.communication` depending on the purpose of your project.
