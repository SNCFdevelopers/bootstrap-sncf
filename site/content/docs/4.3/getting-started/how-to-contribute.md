The SNCF Bootstrap is under continual building. You can rely on it, but it’s also possible to develop this tool with us : for you, but also for others.
So if you are in one of the following cases, don’t hesitate to consult the instructions to contribute !

<summary class="text-primary text-lg mb-2">A component should be in this topic, but you can not find it ?</summary>
{{% markdown %}}
This component may exist in another topic. Links allow you to move from one topic to another related topic (for example for checkbox and radio buttons, a link allows you to find them from the forms section).
If you definitely can not find it, contact us :
