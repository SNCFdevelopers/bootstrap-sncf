### Bootstrap original patches
Major overhaul with original Bootstrap's patches. Here is a non-exhaustive list with major features/corrections, only thoses compatibles with SNCF's Design (although all code is always present for compatibility issues).

- Security fixes (see ship lists below for more details)
- Added new `.flex-fill`, `.flex-grow-*`, and `.flex-shrink-*` utilities.
- Added new `.text-monospace` utility.
- `.form-controls` now have a fixed height to compensate for differences in computed height across different types. This also fixes some IE alignment issues.
- Added new negative margin utility classes (e.g., `.mb-n3`). These rad new classes not only allow you more control over your general spacing needs, but also allow you to create responsive grid gutters at each breakpoint.
- Added `.modal-xl` modifier class for our modals.
- Added `.text-break` utility for applying `word-break: break-word`
- Added `.modal-dialog-scrollable` modifier class for scrolling content within a modal.
- img-retina, invisible, float, and size mixins are now deprecated and will be removed in v5.
