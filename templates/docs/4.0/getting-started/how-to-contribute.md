The SNCF Bootstrap is under continual building. You can rely on it, but it’s also possible to develop this tool with us : for you, but also for others.
So if you are in one of the following cases, don’t hesitate to consult the instructions to contribute !

{% callout-info %}
  [GitHub project page](https://github.com/SNCFdevelopers/bootstrap-sncf)

  [Travis project page](https://travis-ci.com/SNCFdevelopers/bootstrap-sncf/branches) (continuous integration)
{% endcallout %}

## A component should be in this topic, but you can not find it ? 

This component may exist in another topic. Links allow you to move from one topic to another related topic (for example for checkbox and radio buttons, a link allows you to find them from the forms section).

## A component is in this topic but does not work ?
 
Feel free to browse the [GitHub project](https://github.com/SNCFdevelopers/bootstrap-sncf), an issue may have already been created on this topic (you can subscribe to notifications to track its progress). If not, don’t hesitate to create one.
We will come back to you to be able to solve the problem or to know more if necessary and to modify it to push a new version thereafter.

## You have not found a component for your needs but you have developed and want to submit it to us ?

Feel free to make a pull request on the [project’s GitHub](https://github.com/SNCFdevelopers/bootstrap-sncf).

We will study your component, study its design, and if it is in accordance with our charter, we will push it for the other developers to use it. Otherwise, we will rework the design with you until you reach the final version for publication.

## You are in none of the cases mentioned above ?

Do not hesitate to write to us on [design.fab@sncf.fr](mailto:design.fab@sncf.fr?subject=Bootstrap - Autre demande) with the following subject: « Bootstrap - Autre demande »  by specifying your need.
